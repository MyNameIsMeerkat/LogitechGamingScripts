## Spotify Global Hotkeys

This is an AutoHotKey script for global Spotify hotkeys for global app specific track and volume control (reduces/increases volume of Spotify not system wide volume), the keys of Ctrl-Alt-{Up,Down} are then bound the G4 and G11 in the M3 slot of the logitech keyboard. The original script was taken from a AutoHotKey forum post by Sansana ([https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/36239-spotify-global-hotkeys/]() ) and modified slightly.
